```
let [e0,e1]
to take course e0 ,e1 is pre requiste so order is e[1]->e[0]
example:
[[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
adjacency list is
0->1,2
1->3
2->3
```
​
* this is because after studying 0 you can go to 1 and 2
* same goes ,after studying 1 you can study 3
* after studying 2 you can study 3*
​
think how cycle occurs here
